Zimbra Scripts
==============

Every now an then i'll release a script i hacked to share it with the Zimbra Community here.

#### Zannounce.sh

Ever tought about a Distribution List in Zimbra to reach all your Users to send e.g. to send them information about your maintanance plans? I already hat such a DL but i was getting really annoyed klicking new Members to the list or adding them in the CLI. So the script zannounce.sh simply updates your Distribution List announcement@domain.com with all new users.

Note: the criteria for adding a new user is that there must have been a login. There might be nicer solutions for this, but it works for me so far. Quick and dirty hack.
